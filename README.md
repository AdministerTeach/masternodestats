## Q.A:
1. Why discord bot instead of a website?

Discord bot allow us to give user real-time notification for user masernodes right on user smart devices and computer. In addition, user will not be required to reigster their information to us to get service. At the result, user can remain annomynous.

There will be a website in the future. This bot/service is being built from ground up so we would like to focus to get it working roburst then we will make a website for it.
